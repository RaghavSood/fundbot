# Prompt History for FundBot

## Session 1

### Prompt 1
We recently added support for API logging of req/response and headers for all clients.

The table on root@139.59.111.203 is correctly populated in /var/lib/givewei/fundbot.db

However, our admin view just stays stuck on loading, and does not list anything or search

### Prompt 2
This works

Let's update admint to support page refreshes - right now it resets to the Transactions tab on every reload - let's use anchor tags to rember our tab

Additionally, we should add refresh buttons to each view to reload the data without refreshing the whole page

### Prompt 3
Let's update our balances adming view to have base/avalanche ETH/AVAX and USDC as columns - so there is only one row per address

Let's also show the name of the user/chat

Additionally, conduct an in-depth review of our Admin APIs and portal to ensure nothing can be leaked

### Prompt 4
Sometimes, the bot attempts to broadcast the tx and gets stuck

The logs don't show any errors

Feb 05 20:07:57 fundbot-prod fundbot[140261]: 2026/02/05 20:07:57 SimpleSwap USDC transfer sent: 0xf13ceee0e5ca29bd4c742dec15e254917bd74bc6f9a9d9c20bc8242583a2479b

But the transaction never reaches the mempool, and the bot stops responding to future messages until restarted.

Let's analyze the code responsible for this, and fix it

### Prompt 5
Looks like we are having trouble with contracts via private routes

> Raghav Sood:
/topup 0x7e2B383181F7342f55Ca971572b90cB86634eb10 5 ETH.USDC private

> Give Wei:
Asset ETH.USDC not in static list, looking up...

> Give Wei:
Found: USDC (USDC)
Contract: 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48

Confirm this token for your $5.00 topup?

> Give Wei:
Executing swap: $5.00 → ETH.USDC to 0x7e2B383181F7342f55Ca971572b90cB86634eb10...

> Give Wei:
Quote error: no quotes available for ETH.USDC

USDC is supported by both SimpleSwap and HoudiniSwap, yet its not identified - we shouldn't be using solely static lists. Let's expand our dynamic lookup to cover private routes as well
