# Prompt History for FundBot

## Session 1

### Prompt 1
We recently added support for API logging of req/response and headers for all clients.

The table on root@139.59.111.203 is correctly populated in /var/lib/givewei/fundbot.db

However, our admin view just stays stuck on loading, and does not list anything or search

### Prompt 2
This works

Let's update admint to support page refreshes - right now it resets to the Transactions tab on every reload - let's use anchor tags to rember our tab

Additionally, we should add refresh buttons to each view to reload the data without refreshing the whole page

### Prompt 3
Let's update our balances adming view to have base/avalanche ETH/AVAX and USDC as columns - so there is only one row per address

Let's also show the name of the user/chat

Additionally, conduct an in-depth review of our Admin APIs and portal to ensure nothing can be leaked
